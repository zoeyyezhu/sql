**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on previous work, it's clear that incorporating ethics and addressing inequities is not just a nice-to-have but an essential aspect of responsible data management and decision-making. 

It's not enough to just think about fairness within our own systems. We need to zoom out and consider the bigger picture. Are our decisions unintentionally favoring certain groups? Are we listening to the voices of all stakeholders, especially those who might be marginalized?

Adjusting our approach means being proactive. We need to actively look for biases in our data and decision-making processes. Bringing in diverse perspectives can help us see blind spots and ensure that our solutions are truly inclusive.
